                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_1_0">
                    <p>The Zethereum - ZTH cryptocurrency is a token issued on the Signum blockchain in December 2021. 
                       The Signum blockchain allows you to issue smart tokens that can interact with smart contracts.
                       Now ZTH is its own token in the Signum blockchain with the asset ID: <a href="https://chain.signum.network/asset/9518219425200752102" 
                       target="_blank" title="The Zethereum cryptocurrency. (ZTH). Zethereum is constantly growing. 
                       Its goal is to destroy the ecosystems of the former energy-intensive cryptocurrencies. 
                       He is a form of disruptor of inefficient blockchain networks. If you attack it with proton streams, 
                       Zethereum warms up and becomes bigger. But eventually, it will rain down on everyone.">9518219425200752102</a>, 
                       and it is controlled by the <a href="https://chain.signum.network/address/13083988009998497522" 
                       target="_blank" title="Account S-WFRL-SRQQ-KQTY-DBX6D">GrandPoolZTH</a> and <a href="https://chain.signum.network/address/5097376182589737369" 
                       target="_blank" title="Account S-SLET-N86W-B67K-66EHF">GrandRewardZTH</a> smart contracts.</p>
                    <p>The ZTH token was issued in the amount of 100,000,000 units. 70% of the minted coins are available for mining, 
                       another 30% are aimed at the development of the project. In automatic mode, every 6 hours smart contracts distribute 
                       100 ZTH between all participants of mining and staking.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="box box_2">
                <p class="div_bottom_2">How is the mining process?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_2_0">
                    <p>Mining of ZTH tokens is not a process of creating blocks and signing transactions. 
                       It is carried out from smart contracts according to a pre-hard-coded algorithm.</p> 
                    <p>This technology was previously used by the developers of the blockchain and the <a href="https://ton.org/en/mining" target="_blank">TON</a> cryptocurrency. 
                       But TON went down the path of staking in the future. 
                       ZTH continued its development along the path of virtual mining.</p>
                    <p>The smart contract algorithm distributes 100 ZTH every 6 hours between all participants. 
                       And therefore does not use the resources of your equipment at all. 
                       This means that Zethereum can be mined in parallel with the mining of any other cryptocurrency, including SIGNA.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="box box_3">
                <p class="div_bottom_3">Is the ZTH actually a mining process?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_3_0">
                    <p>Signum introduced the world to the decentralized <a href="https://signum.network/pocplus" target="_blank" title="(PoC +)">Proof of Commitment (PoC +)</a> consensus. 
                       Its main advantage is to increase the efficiency of mining by fixing the balance on your own account, 
                       and not by buying new equipment. Such a fixation of the balance is called a commitment. 
                       The greater your commitment, the higher the efficiency of your mining.</p>
                    <p>Zethereum also uses this advantage, allowing the mining process to be carried out by fixing so-called virtual 
                       tokenized gigabytes on your account. The VGB token with the asset ID: <a href="https://chain.signum.network/asset/9381200141252723234" 
                       target="_blank" title="VGB">9381200141252723234</a> performs the function of commitment fixation. 
                       Thus, the more virtual gigabytes you have, the higher the efficiency of your mining.</p>

                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_4_0">
                    <p>The architecture of Zethereum is built on a bundle of three types of smart contracts.</p>

                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_5_0">
                    <p>The economy of Zethereum is not cyclical and is built in such a way that it attracts capital from external sources. 
                       We conclude partnership agreements on mutually beneficial terms, thereby expanding and scaling our business model.</p>
                    <p>At the moment, the economic model of Zethereum receives income from investing in the stock market - it is a monthly 
                       coupon income from bonds and dividends from stocks. Also, income is provided from cryptocurrency affiliate programs, 
                       commissions from the sale of own and partner NFT and DeFi applications.</p>
                    <p>Advertising projects, liquidity pools and partnership agreements with mining pools are next in line. 
                       It is also planned to bring the financial instrument to centralized exchanges.</p>

                    <p>The profitability of ZTH mining consists of various factors. The most important are the cost of the ZTH tokens themselves, 
                       as well as the cost of the SIGNA coin, the number of participants in mining and the complexity of mining 
                       (the number of virtual gigabytes minted), regular dividend payments, as well as periodic partner payments. 
                       At the same time, the cost of ZTH has been steadily growing for the last half a year.</p>

                    <p>Until December 25, 2022, it is still possible to get ZTH for free. The <a href="https://zethereum.siju.me/" target="_blank">AirDrop</a> program is in effect. 
                       You can get up to 10,000 ZTH tokens in exchange for your social media links.</p>
