                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_1_0">
                    <p>The Zethereum - ZTH cryptocurrency is a token issued on the Signum blockchain in December 2021. 
                       The Signum blockchain allows you to issue smart tokens that can interact with smart contracts.
                       Now ZTH is its own token in the Signum blockchain with the asset ID: <a href="https://chain.signum.network/asset/9518219425200752102" 
                       target="_blank" title="The Zethereum cryptocurrency. (ZTH). Zethereum is constantly growing. 
                       Its goal is to destroy the ecosystems of the former energy-intensive cryptocurrencies.

            <div class="box box_2">
                <p class="div_bottom_2">How is the mining process?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_2_0">
                    <p>Mining of ZTH tokens is not a process of creating blocks and signing transactions. 
                       It is carried out from smart contracts according to a pre-hard-coded algorithm.</p> 
                    <p>This technology was previously used by the developers of the blockchain and the <a href="https://ton.org/en/mining" target="_blank">TON</a> cryptocurrency. 
                       But TON went down the path of staking in the future. 
                       ZTH continued its development along the path of virtual mining.</p>
                    <p>The smart contract algorithm distributes 100 ZTH every 6 hours between all participants. 
                       And therefore does not use the resources of your equipment at all. 
                       This means that Zethereum can be mined in parallel with the mining of any other cryptocurrency, including SIGNA.</p>
                    <p>Every 24 hours the Picker contract will check the balance and, if the accumulated amount is greater than 250 Signa, 98% will be distributed to TMG holders and the remaining will the distributed to SmartC NFT holders.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="box box_3">
                <p class="div_bottom_3">Is the TMG actually a mining process?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_3_0">
                    <p>It looks like mining, but there is no block with transactions to be forged. It is a competition to get the best deadline every one hour. The winner takes one token.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="box box_4">
                <p class="div_bottom_4">Do I need to change the intensity of my miner?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_4_0">
                    <p>No. By default the miner will start with the least mining intensity avaliable (0.32). But check the overall mining intensity, because the chance to win a token is proportional to these values.</p>
                    <p>Check <b>How high is the chance to get one TMG token?</b></p>
                </div>

            <div class="box box_5">
                <p class="div_bottom_5">What happens to the Signa I add to the miner?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_5_0">
                    <p>If your miner is mining with the least amount possible (0.32 Signa), most of the balance will be spent in the activation fees of the contracts.</p>
                    <p>This amount needed to run smart contracts is burned by default in Signum. If the mining intensity is bigger, the excess balance will build up in the Picker contract to be distributed every 24 hours.</b></p>

            </div>
            <div class="box box_6">
                <p class="div_bottom_6">Is it possible to get my Signa back?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_6_0">
                    <p>Yes, you can get recover your miner current balance. If you changed your mind and want to stop playing, use <b>My miner</b></p>
                    <p>The refund can take up to one hour, no new deadline is submitted and all miner balance will be returned. A manual alternative is use your wallet program to send at least 0.5 Signa to your contract with a text message stop as attachment.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="box box_7">
                <p class="div_bottom_7">How high is the chance to get one TMG token?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_7_0">
                    <p>It depends on your miner mining intensity and the overall mining intensity. If your miner contributed with .32 Signa and the block had the overall mining intensity of 32 signa.</p>
                    <p>This mean that the chance to win was 0.32/32 -> 0,01 or 1%.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="box box_8">
                <p class="div_bottom_8">How the deadline is calculated?</p>
                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_8_0">
                    <li>Get the transaction ID from your miner to the picker and divide by two. This is the base deadline. Division is needed to avoid negative values internally.</li>
                    <li>Get the transaction amount (mining intensity) and divide by the minimum amount (0.32 Signa). This factor (always greater or equal one) is called mining factor.</li>
                    <li>The final deadline is the base deadline divided by the mining factor. So the greater the mining factor, lower the deadline. In this way, users can adjust the mining intensity to increase change to win a token</li>
                    <li>The id values are big, so in this page the log2 of this value is shown. In theory the worst deadline is 63 bits (integer 9223372036854775807) and the best is 0 bit (integer 1), lower is better. To decrease one bit of your deadline you must multiply by 2 the mining intensity.</li>

                <div class="div_bottom div_bottom_9_0">
                    <p>The individual transactions can be checked at the Picker contract page on the <a href="https://explorer.notallmine.net/address/18339269626061634110">Block Explorer</a></p>
